# CAMELS-HARZ

This repository performs the same input pipeline as for the CAMELS-DE Dataset with gauged data of gauging locations which are currently not implemented within the CAMELS-DE V1, see below.

# CAMELS-DE V1

The CAMELS-DE data set is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12733968

## CAMELS-DE Processing Pipeline

A visualization of the processing pipeline used for the currently available version 1 of CAMELS-DE/CAMELS-DE-HARZ is available as a website here: https://camels-de.org/camels_de/  

The work here is mostly adjusted by Gregor Johnen based on the work of Dolich, A., Espinoza, E. A., Ebeling, P., Guse, B., Götte, J., Hassler, S., Hauffe, C., Kiesel, J., Heidbüchel, I., Mälicke, M., Müller-Thomy, H., Stölzle, M., Tarasova, L., & Loritz, R. (2024).

## Inputs needed
The main inputs needed are the catchment shapefiles as well as the locations of gauging stations respective to those shapefiles
